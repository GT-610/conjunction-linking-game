# Conjuctions Linking game (联结词连连看)
Small conjuction linking game fully written in Python.

## Why this exists?
This tiny project is a final assignment of my teammate and I for our *Python Data Structure and Algorithm* course. Since the class is over, we decided to open-source the whole project for everyone to learn Python and algorithm.



## Run from code
The game is developed in Python 3.12. Make sure you have at least Python 3.10 or above.

1. Install the requirements:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run `main_window.py`:

    ```bash
    python main_window.py
    ```
